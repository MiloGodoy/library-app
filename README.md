# library-app
This repository contains a library application built with React, which connects to a custom Node.js API (built with Express) and utilizes a MySQL database. The application allows users to browse and manage books in the library. The React frontend provides an intuitive user interface for searching, adding, updating, and deleting books. The Node.js backend handles API requests, communicates with the MySQL database, and provides the necessary endpoints for the frontend to interact with the data. This project serves as an example of a full-stack web application using popular technologies and showcases the integration between React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL.
